💼 Professional / Resume Style

A responsive, interactive portfolio builder built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can easily input personal information, upload a photo, and preview a real-time portfolio layout that updates dynamically.
The project also includes a built-in PDF download feature powered by html2pdf.js, allowing instant portfolio export.
Designed with clean, minimal UI and mobile-friendly layout.

🎨 Creative / Personal Branding Style

I built a fully interactive portfolio creator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It lets users design and preview their personal portfolio live — including photo upload, projects, skills, and contact info — and download it instantly as a PDF.
My goal was to blend functionality and design to create a tool that feels simple, elegant, and useful for anyone showcasing their work.

⚙️ Technical-Focused Style

This project is a front-end web app that dynamically generates a portfolio layout from user input.
Built using vanilla JavaScript for reactivity and html2pdf.js for PDF export, it demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design techniques.
It features real-time preview rendering, customizable sections (About, Skills, Projects, etc.), and a modern, clean UI built entirely with HTML and CSS.
